# covid-19_trendAnalysis
This project analyzes and visualizes COVID-19 trends across different regions using scatter plots and interactive maps. The project relies on publicly available data from official sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

##Usage

This will generate scatter plots showing the number of confirmed, recovered, and death cases per country over time, as well as an interactive map displaying circles representing the number of deaths in each geographical location.

You can also save the generated maps as image files by executing the last cell in the notebook, which will output a PNG file containing the map.
